Quickly search and filter categories and taxonomies inside the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

Post Category Filter allows you to filter your post categories and custom taxonomies by adding a fast and intuitive search box on top of the term lists. As you type, the list updates instantly and shows only the categories or terms that match your query, making navigation quick even on sites with hundreds or thousands of entries.

This plugin is designed for users who work with large WordPress websites, complex content structures, or extensive taxonomy sets. Instead of scrolling endlessly through long category lists, you can simply type a few letters and immediately locate the term you need. It provides a smoother editorial workflow and helps reduce time spent searching for the right category during post creation or editing.

Post Category Filter works seamlessly inside the WordPress admin interface and supports all public taxonomies, including custom taxonomies created by themes or plugins. It does not modify your categories or database in any way. It simply adds an efficient, lightweight search layer to help you manage and assign terms more effectively.

If you maintain a high volume of content, run news or magazine style websites, or organize your posts through detailed taxonomies, this plugin can significantly improve your daily publishing workflow. It is a simple but powerful solution for anyone looking to optimize category management, streamline content editing, and enhance usability in the WordPress admin area.
